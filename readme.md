# berlin-gtfs-rt-server

**Poll the [VBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsverbund_Berlin-Brandenburg) [HAFAS endpoint](https://github.com/public-transport/vbb-hafas) to provide a [GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/) feed for Berlin & Brandenburg.**

This project uses [`hafas-client`](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client) & [`hafas-gtfs-rt-feed`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hafas-gtfs-rt-feed) to fetch live data about all vehicles in the Berlin & Brandenburg area and build a live [GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) feed from them.


## Installing & running

*Note*: [`hafas-gtfs-rt-feed`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hafas-gtfs-rt-feed), the library used by this project for building the GTFS-RT feed, has more extensive docs. For brevity and to avoid duplication (with e.g. [`hamburg-gtfs-rt-server`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hamburg-gtfs-rt-server)), the following instructions just cover the basics.

### Prerequisites

`berlin-gtfs-rt-server` needs access to a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server, you can configure a custom host/port by setting the `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

It also needs access to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) 14+ server with [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) installed; Pass custom [`PG*` environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/libpq-envars.html) if you run PostgreSQL in an unusual configuration.

It also needs access to a [NATS Streaming](https://nats-io.gitbook.io/legacy-nats-docs/nats-streaming-server-aka-stan) server (just follow its [installation guide](https://nats-io.gitbook.io/legacy-nats-docs/nats-streaming-server-aka-stan/stan-nats-streaming-server/installing)); Set the `NATS_STREAMING_URL` environment variable if you run it in an unusual configuration.

It also needs the [`sponge` command](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sponge) from the [moreutils package](https://repology.org/project/moreutils/information) to be installed.

The [`start.sh` script](start.sh) requires at least Bash 5.0 to run (because it uses `5.0`); macOS currently bundles Bash 3.2, so use `brew install bash` to install an up-to-date version.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/derhuerst/berlin-gtfs-rt-server.git
cd berlin-gtfs-rt-server
npm install --production
```

### Building the matching index

```shell
npm run build
```

The build script will download [the latest VBB GTFS Static data](https://vbb-gtfs.jannisr.de/latest/) and import it into PostgreSQL. Then, it will add [additional lookup tables to match realtime data with GTFS Static data](https://github.com/derhuerst/match-gtfs-rt-to-gtfs). [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) will need to have access to your database.

### Running

Specify the bounding box to be observed as JSON:

```shell
export BBOX='{"north": 52.52, "west": 13.36, "south": 52.5, "east": 13.39}'
```

`berlin-gtfs-rt-server` uses `hafas-gtfs-rt-feed` underneath, which is split into three parts: polling the HAFAS endpoint (`monitor-hafas` CLI), matching realtime data (`match-with-gtf` CLI), and serving a GTFS-RT feed (`serve-as-gtfs-rt` CLI). You can run all three at once using the `start.sh` wrapper script:

```shell
./start.sh
```

In production, run all three using a tool that restarts them when they crash, e.g. [`systemctl`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units), [`forever`](https://github.com/foreversd/forever#readme) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io).

### via Docker

A Docker image [is available as `derhuerst/berlin-gtfs-rt-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/derhuerst/berlin-gtfs-rt-server).

*Note:* The Docker image *does not* contain Redis, PostgreSQL & NATS. You need to configure access to them using the environment variables documented above (e.g. `NATS_STREAMING_URL`).

```shell
export BBOX='{"north": 52.52, "west": 13.36, "south": 52.5, "east": 13.39}'
# build the matching index
docker run -e BBOX -i -t --rm derhuerst/berlin-gtfs-rt-server ./build.sh
# run
docker run -e BBOX -i -t --rm derhuerst/berlin-gtfs-rt-server
```

### via docker-compose

The example [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) starts up a complete set of containers (`berlin-gtfs-rt-server`, Redis, PostGIS/PostgreSQL, [NATS Streaming](https://nats-io.gitbook.io/legacy-nats-docs/nats-streaming-server-aka-stan)) to generate a GTFS-RT feed

Be sure to set `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, either via a `.env` file or an environment variable.

The environment may be started via

```sh
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mySecretPassword docker-compose up -d
```

After starting, the GTFS-RT feed should be available via `http://localhost:3000/`.

### inspecting the feed

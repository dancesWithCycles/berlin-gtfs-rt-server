# berlin-gtfs-rt-server

**Poll the [VBB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verkehrsverbund_Berlin-Brandenburg) [HAFAS endpoint](https://github.com/public-transport/vbb-hafas) to provide a [GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/) feed for Berlin & Brandenburg.**

This project uses [`hafas-client`](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client) & [`hafas-gtfs-rt-feed`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hafas-gtfs-rt-feed) to fetch live data about all vehicles in the Hamburg & surroundings bounding box and build a live [GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) feed from them.


## Installing & running

### Prerequisites

`berlin-gtfs-rt-server` needs access to a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server, you can configure a custom host/port by setting the `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

It also needs access to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) 12+ server; Pass custom [`PG*` environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-envars.html) if you run PostgreSQL in an unusual configuration.

It also needs access to a [NATS Streaming](https://docs.nats.io/nats-streaming-concepts/intro) server (just follow its [setup guide](https://docs.nats.io/nats-streaming-server/run)); Set the `NATS_URL` environment variable if you run it in an unusual configuration.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/derhuerst/berlin-gtfs-rt-server.git
cd berlin-gtfs-rt-server
npm install --production
```

### Building the matching index

```shell
npm run build
```

The build script will download [the latest VBB GTFS Static data](https://vbb-gtfs.jannisr.de/latest/) and import it into PostgreSQL. Then, it will add [additional lookup tables to match realtime data with GTFS Static data](https://github.com/derhuerst/match-gtfs-rt-to-gtfs). [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) will need to have access to your database.

### Running

Specify the bounding box to be observed as JSON:

```shell
export BBOX='{"north": 52.52, "west": 13.36, "south": 52.5, "east": 13.39}'
```

`berlin-gtfs-rt-server` uses `hafas-gtfs-rt-feed` underneath, which is split into three parts: polling the HAFAS endpoint (`monitor-hafas` CLI), matching realtime data (`match-with-gtf` CLI), and serving a GTFS-RT feed (`serve-as-gtfs-rt` CLI). You can run all three at once using the `start.sh` wrapper script:

```shell
./start.sh
```

In production, run all three using a tool like [`systemctl`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units), [`forever`](https://github.com/foreversd/forever#readme) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) that restarts them when they crash.
